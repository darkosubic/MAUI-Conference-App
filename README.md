# Conference Application based on .Net Maui
The purpose of this repo is to introduce members of [FFW Agency](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage") to .NET MAUI.


We will start by explaining what .NET MAUI is, why was it created and when it would make sense to use it.
Next, we will get our hands dirty by explaining and implementing principles/layouts/controls/styles.

Layouts we will cover in this session:

[StackLayout](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/layouts/stacklayout)

[Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/layouts/grid)


Controls we will cover:

[Label,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/label)

[Button,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/button)

[Image,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/image)

[CollectionView,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/collectionview/layout)

[ListView,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/listview)

[ScrollView,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/scrollview)

[Frame](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/frame)


Also, we will be talking about the basics of styling elements, pages or entire applications with [Styles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/styles/xaml)

To follow along you will need to install the Visual Studio 2022 **Preview** version (Community/Professional/Enterprise).
**It is not possible** to have Visual Studio 2022 in **Stable** and **Preview** versions installed at the same moment. If you already have Visual Studio 2022 installed on your machine, you can find simple instructions on how to upgrade it to the **Preview** version [here](https://medium.com/p/how-to-get-missing-net-maui-templates-in-visual-studio-7c86d3dac739).

At the end of this training, we will build a multiplatform app (mobile/desktop) whose goal will be to organize a Conference and which will allow users to see the Conference details and apply to it (as a Presenter or a visitor).
